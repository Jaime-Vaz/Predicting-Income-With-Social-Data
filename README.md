# Predicting-Income-With-Social-Data
Unlike other data science methods, linear regression models will allow us to not only predict the value of a respondent’s income, but provide information on how a variable impacts respondent income.

The Panel Survey of Income Data is the longest-running longitudinal household survey in the world. Survey responses related to social, economic, and health outcomes have been collected from the families and their descendants since 1968. This dataset is widely used by social scientists to investigate the relationship between individual characteristics, like gender or age, and broader socioeconomic outcomes like educational achievement and lifetime income. In this project, you’ll have the chance to use PSID data and linear regression to predict the labor-derived income of survey respondents based on the following set of variables:

gender: the gender, female-identifying, male-identifying, or other, of a respondent
age: the age of the respondent
married: the marital status, unmarried, married, or divorced, of a respondent
employed: the employment status of the respondent at the time of survey collection
educated_in_us: whether the respondent went to primary school in the United Statues
highest_degree: the highest educational degree obtained by the respondent
education_years: the total number of years of formal education completed by the respondent
labor_income: the yearly income earned by the respondent from a salary or hourly employment
